"""
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of
the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram,
because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True
if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
