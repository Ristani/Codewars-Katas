Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain
a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input
String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.
